# FLTK PLATFORMER
A simple platforming game using the PyFLTK wrapper for FLTK 1.3.5.

### About
I hacked this platformer together in my grade 10 year using a python GUI toolkit called pyFLTK.
This is somewhat notable because FLTK is not designed for building games, in any capacity. Also, pyFLTK in general is, like, really really bad. Installing it can simply refuse to work, as it's a convoluted wrapper for a C++ toolkit that you shouldn't use either when way better alternatives like Qt exist.
Either way, if you still want to try it out, install pyFLTK and run the `fltkplatformer.py` file in the `src/` directory.

### Features
- basic platforming elements (blocks, spikes)
- jump pads
- varying level sizes
- wall jumping
